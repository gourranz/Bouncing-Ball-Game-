### Description
  #### The single-player game has two levels, and each level has bricks, a plate, and a ball. The goal of this game is to destroy every brick and make sure the ball doesn't pass the plate to the buttom of the game screen. The player will control the plate and move it right and left with a slow speed; the user will do that using the keyboard for input.
